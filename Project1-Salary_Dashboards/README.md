# Excel Salary Dashboards

An Excel Salary Dashboard for Data Science job titles is a dynamic tool designed to provide in-depth analysis and insights into the salary data for Data Science roles. This dashboard allows users to filter and compare salary information based on specific countries and work schedule types (such as full-time, part-time, or contract).

 It not only visualizes salary trends but also provides key statistical calculations, including the median salary for specific job titles and the count of jobs based on country.
